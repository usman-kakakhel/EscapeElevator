# EscapeElevator
Mini microprocessor for an elevator serving as an emergency elevator which clears buildings in an efficient manner. This processor was designed using HLSM and implemented in SystemVerilog.

The srcs folder contains all the System Verilog code which has been used to implement the Elevator by using HLSM.
This System Verilog code has specifically been written for BASYS3(FPGA).
